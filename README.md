## What is this Website For?

Hello and welcome to the team! This website is your personal training guide to help you get up to speed on everything you need to know to be a successful member of the MidnighTreats family.

Think of it as an interactive handbook. Instead of just reading pages of information, you'll go through a series of engaging modules that cover all the essentials, from our company culture and food safety standards to customer service best practices and how to operate our systems.

## How It Works

The process is simple and designed to let you learn at your own pace.

1.  **Create Your Profile:** To get started, you'll create a simple profile with your name and email. If you ever leave and come back, the site will remember you so you can pick up right where you left off.

2.  **Learn Step-by-Step:** You'll see a dashboard with all the training modules. You'll need to complete them in order, as each one builds on the last.

3.  **Test Your Knowledge:** At the end of each module, there's a short quiz to make sure you've got the key information down. You'll need to pass the quiz to unlock the next module. Don't worry, you'll have a few chances to get it right!

4.  **Track Your Progress:** Your dashboard will always show you how far you've come and what's next on your training journey.

5.  **Earn Your Certificate:** Once you've successfully passed all the modules, you'll be awarded an official Certificate of Completion. You can download this certificate as a PDF to save for your records and share it with your manager.

We're excited to have you on board, and we hope this tool makes your first few days (and beyond) smooth, fun, and successful!
